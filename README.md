# Blockchain-Enabled Public Transit Optimization

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to optimize public transit operations through transparent data collection, automated decision-making, and decentralized governance. By implementing smart contracts for ridership tracking, schedule adjustments, maintenance scheduling, and fuel efficiency monitoring, this solution provides transit authorities with reliable, tamper-proof data while enhancing operational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Transparent Ridership Data**: Real-time passenger volume tracking across all routes and times
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Automated schedule adjustments based on historical and current demand patterns
- **Preventative Maintenance**: Smart scheduling of vehicle maintenance based on actual usage metrics
- **Energy Optimization**: Continuous monitoring and improvement of fuel/energy consumption
- **Decentralized Governance**: Shared decision-making capabilities among transit stakeholders

## Core Smart Contracts

### 1. Ridership Tracking Contract

Monitors and records passenger volumes across all routes and transit modes.

- Records entry/exit data at each stop
- Aggregates data by route, time of day, and day of week
- Provides historical trend analysis
- Generates capacity utilization reports

### 2. Schedule Adjustment Contract

Optimizes transit timing based on real-time and historical demand data.

- Analyzes ridership patterns to identify peak demand periods
- Automatically proposes schedule modifications
- Implements approved changes through dispatch integration
- Maintains service level agreement compliance

### 3. Maintenance Scheduling Contract

Manages vehicle maintenance based on actual usage metrics.

- Tracks vehicle mileage, operating hours, and conditions
- Schedules preventative maintenance based on manufacturer specifications
- Prioritizes repairs based on criticality and passenger impact
- Optimizes fleet availability during peak demand periods

### 4. Fuel Efficiency Contract

Monitors and optimizes energy consumption across the transit fleet.

- Records fuel/energy usage per vehicle and route
- Identifies inefficient vehicles or routes
- Suggests driving pattern modifications to improve efficiency
- Calculates carbon footprint and sustainability metrics
